# Quantum-Racing-FEA
This repository contains the structural validation and optimization of a steering knuckle extension for a Formula SAE-style vehicle. The project transitions from traditional manual FEA to an automated data-driven workflow using Python to process simulation results, enabling rapid design iteration and objective decision-making.
